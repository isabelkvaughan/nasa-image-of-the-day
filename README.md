## Project Title

Astronomy Image Of The Day

## Project Description

Astronomy Image Of the Day uses NASA's API to present the Image of the Day with the title and a brief blurb explaining the image. The date selecter allows the user to go back in time and revisit previous Images of the Day, and learn more in the world of Astronomy. The exisitng NASA page does not have the funcitonality to go back in time and see previous images.

## User Story

AS A Student, Teacher, Astronomy enthusiast
I WANT A website where I can access NASA's Astronomy Image Of The Day Archive
WHERE I CAN select any date in the past, and view the Image and read a blurb about the image
SO THAT I have a valuable resource for learning and exploring astronomy.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN when I open the applciation, and see the latest Image Of The Day, with the title, image and a brief blurb about the image. 
THEN I can use a date selector to choose any past date
THEN I will be presented with the update title, image and blurb for that chosen image. 

## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

![Header with title. Date and Date selecter in left panel. Image of the Day displayed on the right with title above and blurb below.](./assets/images/screenshot.png)

## Limitations

As the NASA API is run from USA, this application has to run one day behind, due to time zone differences, as the Image of the Day is only available once the date hits in the US.
